# VerifiableLedger: Immutable Consensus with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

A decentralized, Merkle-rooted state transition engine with zk-SNARK verification and Byzantine fault tolerance for immutable, verifiable consensus.

VerifiableLedger provides a robust framework for building secure and transparent distributed applications. This system leverages a combination of proven cryptographic techniques, including Merkle trees for data integrity, zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) for verifiable computation, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) to ensure consensus even in the presence of malicious actors. The architecture is designed to achieve immutability, transparency, and verifiable correctness of state transitions within a decentralized network. This is crucial for applications requiring high levels of trust and security, such as supply chain management, verifiable voting, and decentralized finance (DeFi).

At its core, VerifiableLedger operates as a state machine, where each state transition represents a change to the ledger's data. These transitions are cryptographically secured using Merkle trees, allowing for efficient verification of data integrity. Furthermore, zk-SNARKs enable the verification of state transitions without revealing the underlying data. This is particularly important for preserving privacy and confidentiality while ensuring the correctness of computations performed on the data. The BFT consensus mechanism ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the valid state transitions, even if some nodes are acting maliciously.

By combining these technologies, VerifiableLedger offers a unique solution for building decentralized systems that are both secure and verifiable. It provides a platform where trust is not placed on a single entity but is instead distributed among a network of nodes, each capable of independently verifying the integrity and correctness of the ledger. The result is a highly resilient and transparent system that can be used to build a wide range of applications where trust and security are paramount. Its modular design allows for customization and integration with other systems, making it a versatile tool for developers building next-generation decentralized applications.

Key Features:

*   **Merkle-Rooted State Transitions:** Each state transition is anchored in a Merkle tree, ensuring the immutability and verifiability of the ledger's history. The root of the Merkle tree acts as a cryptographic fingerprint of the entire ledger's state. Implementations use SHA-256 hashing for cryptographic integrity.
*   **zk-SNARK Verification:** Utilizes zk-SNARKs for verifiable computation, enabling the verification of state transitions without revealing sensitive data. Implemented using the Groth16 proving system via a Go binding to a Zokrates circuit compiler. Specifically, it supports custom circuits defining valid state transitions, ensuring deterministic execution and verifiable results.
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):** Employs a BFT consensus algorithm (e.g., Tendermint or HotStuff) to ensure agreement on the valid state of the ledger, even in the presence of malicious nodes. The core implementation will include pluggable consensus engine interface allowing users to choose suitable BFT algorithm based on their needs.
*   **Decentralized Architecture:** Operates as a peer-to-peer network, distributing trust and eliminating single points of failure. The node discovery mechanism leverages Gossip protocols for efficient peer management and communication.
*   **Go Implementation:** Built using the Go programming language, known for its performance, concurrency, and security features. The concurrency model is based on Go's goroutines and channels, facilitating efficient parallel processing of state transitions and network communication.
*   **Configurable Transaction Processing:** Allows for the definition of custom transaction types and validation logic, providing flexibility to adapt the system to various application requirements. Transactions are processed in batches to improve throughput and reduce latency.
*   **Auditable History:** Maintains a complete and immutable history of all state transitions, enabling auditing and forensics. The historical data is stored using an append-only data structure, preventing any modifications or deletions.

Technology Stack:

*   **Go:** The core programming language for the VerifiableLedger implementation, providing performance, concurrency, and security.
*   **Merkle Trees (SHA-256):** Used for cryptographic data integrity and efficient verification of data presence and consistency.
*   **zk-SNARKs (Groth16):** Enables verifiable computation and privacy-preserving state transitions.
*   **BFT Consensus Algorithm (Tendermint/HotStuff):** Ensures agreement on the valid state of the ledger in a decentralized network.
*   **Protocol Buffers (protobuf):** Defines the data serialization format for efficient communication between nodes.
*   **gRPC:** Framework for RPC calls and communication between services.
*   **LevelDB:** High-performance key-value store for storing the ledger's state.

Installation:

1.  Ensure Go is installed (version 1.18 or higher).
2.  Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/VerifiableLedger.git
3.  Navigate to the project directory: cd VerifiableLedger
4.  Download dependencies: go mod download
5.  Build the project: go build -o verifiableledger cmd/verifiableledger/main.go

Configuration:

VerifiableLedger can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., `config.toml`).

Environment Variables:

*   `VL_NODE_ID`: Unique identifier for the node.
*   `VL_LISTEN_ADDRESS`: Address and port to listen for incoming connections (e.g., `0.0.0.0:8080`).
*   `VL_BOOTSTRAP_NODES`: Comma-separated list of bootstrap node addresses (e.g., `127.0.0.1:8081,127.0.0.1:8082`).
*   `VL_DATA_DIR`: Directory to store the ledger's data.
*   `VL_CONSENSUS_TYPE`: Type of consensus algorithm to use (e.g., `tendermint`, `hotstuff`).

Configuration File Example (`config.toml`):

 node_id = "node1"
 listen_address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
 bootstrap_nodes = ["127.0.0.1:8081", "127.0.0.1:8082"]
 data_dir = "/path/to/data"
 consensus_type = "tendermint"

Usage:

To start a VerifiableLedger node, run the executable:

./verifiableledger --config config.toml

Alternatively, use environment variables:

VL_NODE_ID=node1 VL_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8080 VL_BOOTSTRAP_NODES=127.0.0.1:8081 ./verifiableledger
